The aim of this major project is to design and implement a 5 Stage MIPS 32 pipelined processor capable of
executing R-type instructions, store word and load word instructions, as well as beq and jump instructions. The
processor should also effectively handle data and control hazards, ensuring efficient and accurate execution of
instructions.
